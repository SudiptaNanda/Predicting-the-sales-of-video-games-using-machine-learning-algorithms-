The purpose of this Kernel is to investigate what would be an accurate Machine Learning model to forecast video game sales in units based on the features given in this dataset. There are several ML algotrithms to be explored but for the sake of today's discussion, the analysis is performed using three supervised ML models i.e. Linear regression , RandomForest regressor and Support vector regressor.
